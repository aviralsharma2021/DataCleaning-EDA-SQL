Data cleansing and Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL Server

Aviation Accidents Dataset from Kaggle is used for Data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL Server.

This Project is to showcase my SQL skillset 

The dataset used was downloaded from Kaggle, the cleaning.sql file contains the data cleaning script in sql.

The dataset needs to be imported to SQL Server (syntax for different DBMS may be different for some queries)
